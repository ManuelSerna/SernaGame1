# SernaGame1
A simple game written in Java

Type of game: a fantasy-style RPG

Ideas
  -top-down game with sprites (think 1985 Legend of Zelda, sprites obviously more modern)
  -Entities
   -standard entity: move, talk (dialogue options like in Elder Scrolls, interact with world, heal, attack (physical: swords, bows and arrows; or magic), defend, contiain basic inventory,other moves(?)
    -player: more advanced inventory system, receive input from user, change armor(?), choose traits(?), companions
    -allies/NPCs: can follow player, independently move, attack when provoked (NPCs)
    -enemy: attack on sight, can alert other enemies, maybe a boss class can inherit from this?
   -animals/creature: completely different class(?): also would have sprite generation, movement, interaction (moving, attacking, defending), maybe talk
